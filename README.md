# MoMA Artwork Collection Analysis

This project is the final assignment of the Data Analysis Bootcamp (Oct-Dec 2023) at [AllWomen Tech](https://www.allwomen.tech/).

## Overview

The analysis focuses on the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) artwork collection, specifically exploring the Acquisition Year, Credit, Artist Name, and Gender columns. The goal is to understand how the collection has evolved over the years, where artworks predominantly originated during peak acquisition years, identify top artists with the most artwork, and examine gender disparity within the collection.
